Hey there! My name is Arman Alexander Jordan, and I've been making games since I was 6 years old.

I grew up imagining fantastical worlds, playing dungeon master for my siblings and neighborhood friends, where I found immense joy in creating enjoyable experiences for others. I went through a phase of constructing foam weapons including swords and axes from pvc pipes padded with pool noodles, and would design games for the 20+ children of my neighborhood to play together(like modified hunger games and juggernaut).

When I turned 12, my mom put me into a coding bootcamp, where I programmed my first choose your own adventure game! From there I couldn't stop, and churned out game after game using whatever medium I could. I programmed 50+ games using Scratch up until the end middle-school. Through highschool I would create adventure maps in Minecraft for my loved ones, and organize boxing competitions where hundreds of students from my school would attend and compete.

I brought my passion to UC Santa Cruz for my undergraduate degree, and developed my technical skills while learning how to lead teams towards success. I excelled in college and was accepted to every Masters program I applied to, including the one I am attending now at The University of Southern California. The fast-paced and directed teaching here makes me feel at home, and I'm more excited than ever to show the world what I can create!
